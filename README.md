# Peppubuild Visual Editor
## Open source (Nocode/Lowcode) tool using JavaScript Frameworks and Languages you like.

Peppubuild is an open source alternative to [Bubble](https://bubble.io). However, we're taking the decoupled headless CMS approach.

You can build a full-stack application and also connect to the database of their choice with Peppubuild's visual editor. Since Peppubuild is a decoupled headless CMS, you can build only your application's frontend or backend with Peppubuild and continue your development in other editors of your choice. 

The goal of Peppubuild is to allow teams build faster, while giving them full control of their codes. Since this is a Nocode/Lowcode tool, Nocode developers can build their web applications, without the need to write any code. Developers can also customise their application how they want.

Peppubuild is opensource, users can use our cloud version (nocode), self-hosted (developer-first/lowcode) version or clone the repository.

## Status
- [x] Alpha: We're testing Peppubuild with a closed set of customers.
- [ ] Public Alpha: Peppubuild is unstable but users can signup. 
- [ ] Public Beta: Peppubuild is stable enough for members of the public to use. Since it is still in test phase, users may find some errors.
- [ ] Public: Peppubuild is now stable for public use.

The current version of Peppubuild is the Alpha stage. If you would like to join the test, [register your interest in this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf1qQVoPErBs95Om7U5wnPuPWLm6Xmgvcs6FA1rCxVhpUtcsA/viewform?usp=sf_link).

## How it Works
Peppubuild currently offers a self-hosted option, with our Github repository. For this, clone the Peppubuild repository:

```shell
npm run start
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:1404` in your browser and start using Peppubuild.
